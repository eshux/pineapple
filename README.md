# Web Developer Test

[Click here](https://eshux.github.io/charts/) to see the project.

This project was created with ReactJS and MySQL database.

The project consists of two parts - server-side and client-side. Each part should be run separately.

---

# Client-side

### `npm install`

To install missing modules.

### `npm start`

To start the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client side of the project in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

---

# Server-side

MySQL database and server have been set up locally, so you won't be able to test the server-side of the project yourself, but feel free to check the code.
